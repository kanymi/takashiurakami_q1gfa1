    <p>>My name is Takashi Urakami. I am 14 years old. I was born and raised in the Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan, now I live in the Philippines. I often play many games, but a notable type of genre is FPS and Indie games, such as Celeste, Terraria, Slime Rancher, and VALORANT. I also have an interest in Robotics and things related to Robotics, such as Computer Science. I am part of the Robotics Club ALA, and we are preparing for this Wednesday.</p>
